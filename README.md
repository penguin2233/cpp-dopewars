cpp-dopewars is a game focusing on buying and selling drugs.

note: the process of drug dealing may be illegal where you live. this game is purely fictional

## DLC Support
cpp-dopewars loads in DLCs with DLL importing. To start the game with DLC, you need to specify the DLC's DLL file in the command line arguments.

```cmd
dope-wars.exe opium.dll
```

The base game has no anti-piracy measures in place, but my DLC (Opium) does. It pings my [server](https://penguin2233.gq/projects/cpp-dopewars/key.php) with the key encoded in URL parameters. I go into more detail on my website [here](https://penguin2233.gq/projects/cpp-dopewars).

You can make your own DLCs as well, Opium's code is in the "opium" folder.
